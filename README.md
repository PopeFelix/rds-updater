rds-updater
===========

Script to periodically update an Inovonics RDS encoder from a Simian automation system.

Like many of my other projects on GitHub, this is aimed specifically at KTBG, 'cos that's where I work.  It is provided 
publicly in the hope that it might serve as a useful example to another developer or engineer.
